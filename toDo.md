### MAYBE
1. if rotate off - disable face accordion (show popup on click)
2. save settings into Cookie or Local storage or Session storage - find solution
3. turn off score(face) on mobile devices - or default = symbol - if cardWrapper width < xy turn off score/default symbol

### CODE REFACTORING
1. accordion nested for loop => es6
2. add true/false mechanism inside functions that you call with eventListener(where you need to add and remove listener) - ask inside func if some true/false 

### BUG
1. add time in different scenarios
2. ios sample - play() problem
3. if turn on/off switches (rotate/sound) - second card bug
