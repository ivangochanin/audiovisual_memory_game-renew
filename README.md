### AudioVisual memory game renew
The game is, above all, intended for musicians, but also for those who want to learn musical notation and ear training.
Enthusiasm started this project. The main purpose is learning javascript, webpack and so on .... 
Iâ€™m not sure what would be the best way to upload audio samples, so if anyone can help, I'll be grateful.
Thanks.
