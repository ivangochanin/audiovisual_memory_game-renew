## AudioVisual memory game renew
The game is, above all, intended for musicians, but also for those who want to learn musical notation and ear training.
Enthusiasm started this project. The main purpose is learning javascript, webpack, and so on... 
Iâ€™m not sure what would be the best way to upload audio samples, so if anyone can help, I'll be grateful. This is it, for now.
Thanks.

> The game is intended for desktop(Chrome), but it can also be used (somehow) on Android. 

> On iOS devices, already used, samples may not be loaded correctly (async-await doesn't help) or the game may freeze occasionally - sound.load() problem. Safari, on macOS, could also mess around with sound playing.
